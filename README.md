# Bootcamp Website Project

A project I was tasked with on a software dev bootcamp.

I was asked to try to copy a website of my choice, I decided to try to replicate https://www.gamersensei.com/ using vanilla CSS even though the original website uses a framework for their CSS.

To-Do:

- add the rest of the sections
- try to make it responsive
